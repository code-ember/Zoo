# Zoo
Functionality will be enforced by selectively implementing interfaces to replicate the behavior of real animals

## Introduction
In this course, you learned about methods, method signatures, classes and objects, inheritance, interfaces, and the intricacies involved in these concepts. To put it simply, if you were learning carpentry, you've now mastered how to saw wood, hammer nails, screw in fasteners, and read blueprints. However, just like in carpentry, where these skills only come together when you build something like a chair or piece of furniture, your programming knowledge won't come together until you apply it to create a small program.

## The purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to assess your understanding of the concepts covered in this course. It assumes you have already mastered the skills from the previous modules. While it won't directly test you on those earlier topics, you may encounter them in the starter code. If you find yourself confused by any of these concepts, it would be a good idea to revisit and review those topics first.

The objective of this project is to give you the opportunity to apply what you've learned so far to a practical program, allowing you to refine and perfect your skills.

## The goal of the project
The project goal is to utilize abstract classes interfaces, and functionality of interfaces to help create a small zoo with a tiger and a dolphin, each inheriting common properties from an Animal class. You will extend the Animal class to create these unique animals.  

The Animal class implements an interface named Eat. The interface has two methods, but it implements only one. Since the Animal class does not implement all the methods of the Eat interface, the child classes will implement the unimplemented methods. You will also create two interfaces named Walk and Swim and apply the functionality of the methods of the Walk and Swim interfaces in certain classes only.   

You will modify an interactive menu system to work with the objects of the classes that you create. Additionally, you will develop a multi-functional Penguin class that can both walk and swim. Finally, you’ll test the entire program to ensure all functionalities work seamlessly.

## What to expect from the project
This is a graded lab. You will receive marks at the end of the lab when you submit your work. The project will be graded as follows:

- **Task 1 (Inheritance):** The Tiger and Dolphin classes correctly inherit from the Animal class and implement the required methods from the Eat interface.
- **Task 2 (Functionality creation and implementation):** The Swim and Walk interfaces are correctly created and implemented in the Dolphin and Tiger classes.
- **Task 3 (Classes, objects, methods, and basic constructs in  Java):** The menu system correctly displays the details and behaviors of the selected animals based on user input.
- **Task 4 (New Penguin class functionality):** The Penguin class implements both the Walk and Swim interfaces and functions correctly for both walking and swimming.
- **Task 5 (Overall program functionality):** All tasks and functionalities work together cohesively as expected.

This wil test your understanding and implementation of Java code across one or more of the following topics:
- Methods
- Method signatures
- Classes and objects
- Polymorphism using method overloading and overriding
- Inheritance
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Multiple inheritance using Interfaces

You are working towards becoming a Certified Amazon Junior Software Developer and may have the opportunity to work as a Java Software Engineer in many tech companies. This won’t be a simple walk in the park; it's more like navigating through a jungle. However, you've completed all the steps leading up to this point and have the skills to overcome this challenge! 

## Conclusion
Everything you’ve learned in this course has led to this project. This is your opportunity to showcase your understanding and practical application of the skills you’ve developed.
